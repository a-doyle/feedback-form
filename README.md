# feedback-form
A simple feedback form demonstrating integration of PHP into a HTML webpage

This demonstrates how PHP can be integrated into HTML forms, augmenting and enhancing them.
Various selection types are used to display how PHP can be used in error-checking all possible aspects of a user-friendly form with concise and clear error messages, if applicable.

Tested using WAMP, this works as you would expect, with basis for automated replies. 

The program also fends off possible SQL injection attacks by covering possible routes for such attacks.

To view the program, PHP must be downloaded and these files stored in your root directory for your chosen web server.
